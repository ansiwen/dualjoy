# DualJoy

This is a firmware for the Rapsberry Pi Pico that turns it into a USB adapter
for _two_ D-Sub 9 joysticks, as they where used with the Atari 2600 console and
the Commodore C64 and Amiga home computers. They will appear as two digital
hats/d-pads with only one button.

The code is based on the various examples of the Pico SDK and TinyUSB and keeps
their MIT license.
